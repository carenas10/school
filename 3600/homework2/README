-------- PROJECT 2 - CPSC 3600 - REMY - JACKSON DAWKINS --------

This project implements a DNS client in C using UDP sockets. It makes a request,
and prints out the information received from the server.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
	the printout doesn't always find all the information returned
	from the server, such as TTL, and auth status, properly.

	Retries were not implemented. Not enough time.

DESIGN
	the program's parsing and UDP logic were separated into separate files.
	both the parsing logic and UDP logic have header files with all includes,
	structs, and prototypes.
	This was done to clean up the individual files, and make it easier to
	understand.

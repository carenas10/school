SIMPLE HTTP CLIENT AND SERVER
FOR CPSC 3600, DR. REMY

------------------------ DESIGN ------------------------ 
This project is a simple http server handling GET requests. It is written using
C and TCP sockets. It uses simple string parsing, and for many issues relies
on the fact that the client should be issuing valid requests. I separated many 
of the parsing and string manipulation functions (such as prepend) from the
main routine for simplicity and readability.

------------------------ KNOWN PROBLEMS ------------------------
This http client has sandboxing issues and sometimes has
trouble sending the correct error when a permissions issue is run into.

I also did not implement the HEAD protocol, so results of issuing HEAD
requests to the server are ambiguous and may contain errors or incorrect data.

Timothy Slaton
CpSc 3600 - Final Group Robot Proxy Project
(Group members were Jake Dawkins and Matthew Deangelis)

BUILD:
	*The project is built by typing 'make'

	*The server is run by typing './robotServer port# robot_IP robot_ID image_ID'
	 (fill in the parameters appropriately)

	*The client is run by typing './robotClient middleware_IP port robot_ID L N'
	 (fill in the parameters appropriately)

KNOWN PROBLEMS:
	*The client does not output the responses to files

	*The client does not issue any GET IMAGE requests. However,
	 it would be able to successfully issue those requests to the middleware.
	 It's just not implemented

	*The timeout is not implemented. For this client, it assumes it will not
	 experience a significant delay

DESIGN:
	*The design is discussed in the final video.

Assignment 4 

Group 3: 
Spencer Provost: static_mpi.c, pbs script, & documentation 
Sarah Malick: static_mpi.c & dynamic_mpi.c 
Jackson Dawkins: CloudLab & dynamic_mpi.c 
Abrar Basha: static_mpi.c & documentation 

Collaboration Statement: 
We worked solely as team, using only course materials and the MPI library documentation site provided in the lecture slides. 

Problems/Issues: 
Our program fails when using malloc to allocate space to send back the random array generated by the worker. It fails at about 
200 to 250 workloads each time. For testing functionality we have left it commented it out, since we actually don't use 
the array of integers, we just don't send it. This way we were able to still test and retrieve the results needed for 
the assignment.

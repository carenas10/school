PROJECT 2 - MYTHREADS
AUTHOR: Jackson Dawkins
DUE: 3.10.2015


------------------------ KNOWN PROBLEMS ------------------------
- does not implement the sync functions yet so locks WILL NOT work :(
	cause: due date quickly approaching :((((

- make test will produce a make error that hasn't been solved, but runs
the test successfully. Not sure what that is


------------------------ DESIGN ------------------------
- Nothing too fancy with the design. I used a circular queue
implemented by a doubly linked list. That was just because
of the dynaic requirements of the library. I used this structure 
because it's quite easy to implement for this. There is always a thread
and context that can be called next. I'd be willing to bet money
I'm not the only one who tried this...

*also in mythreads.c

|				THREADLIST				|
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
|THREADNODE |THREADNODE |THREADNODE |THREADNODE |THREADNODE |THREADNODE |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|main thread|		|	    |		|	    |		|
|prev -> end|	...	|    ...    |	...	|    ...    |<---- prev |
|next------>|		|	    |		|	    |next-> head|
+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+
   OLDEST -----------------------> NEWER ---------------------> NEWEST

- I used another linked list for managing the return values for the
same reason as the thread queue... dynamic memory allocation.

- I implemented all of my list management functions inline within
the API code since each one is only called once, and keeps the code
pretty easy to follow. I commented well so those pieces shouldn't be
hard to pick out. At least they aren't for me... but then again I 
wrote them so what do I really know... :l

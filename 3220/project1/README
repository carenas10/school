CPSC 3220 - Dr. Jacob Sorber

------------------------Project Description------------------------
This is a project for cpsc 3220 taught by Dr. Jacob Sorber. Topics
included are interprocess communication, forking and threads, process tracing, 
system calls, etc.

------------------------KNOWN PROBLEMS------------------------
when running ./sctracer, sometimes it will print out warnings saying
that the file could not be found (for example, ls does this), but will still
run and print out the results to the output file specified.

------------------------DESIGN------------------------
Leaktrace uses a very large array of structs to track the mallocs. These structs
include the size and address of each malloc made. The way the program knows if a 
malloc has been freed is by setting the size field to -1. All of the final calculations
are done in the cleanup() function. 

The sctracer works very similarly to Dr. Sorber's in-class example of ptrace.
There is an array of 500 items, and each time a system call #x is made, the counter
on the array[x] is increased. This allows the program to know both the number of the
system call as well as the number of times each call has been made.

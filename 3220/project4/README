FAT Finder (find all files on fat12 and output)

------------------------ DESCRIPTION ------------------------
This program opens a image and mmaps to an array. It also checks 
input parameters to see if it needs to make an output directory. 

It then recursively dives into each directory, starting with the root (/)
Inside the function the does the 'diving', readDirectory(), checks each
directory entry, one-by-one. If the file is deleted, or visible, it 
begins processing the file and outputs. The function tests each entry
using another function to see if the entry is another directory. If the
entry is a directory, it then calls itself recursively.

------------------------ KNOWN PROBLEMS ------------------------
When printing to STDOUT, it had a tendency to add a random byte to the
end of the path. This had to be something from strcat(). We patched this
by checking if the last byte in each path was outside of normal ascii 
"printable" character range. This fixed the problem. We probably could've
dug deeper to find out why this was happening, but our patch works for
time reasons.
